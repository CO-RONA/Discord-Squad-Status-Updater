## About

This is the most basic status updater for squad, I don't even know why I did this.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository via your terminal/cmd: `git clone https://github.com/CO-RONA/Discord-Squad-Status-Updater`
2. Configure the `config.js` file.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn` via the terminal.
4. Start your bot: `node index.js&`. (**I recommend you to use [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io)**)
5. Star this repo if you liked!
